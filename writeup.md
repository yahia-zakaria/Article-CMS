Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app:-


1- Azure VMs are more expensive to run in comparison to Azure App Service.

2- Azure App Service have constraints in comparison to Azure VMs in terms of scalability. Hence, Azure VMs are preferred for apps, which have scope to expand for future.

3- Azure App Service requires much less managerial efforts in comparison to Azure Virtual Machines.
The development of app is much simpler and faster in Azure App Service.

4- Azure VMs offer developer more control over the environment. Like, one can’t choose underlying OS of VM in an Azure App Service.

5- Azure App Services do not offer Pay-as-you-Go. Hence, you’re paying for the service plan, even if you’re not using it.

6- There may be constraints for the support of certain programming languages on Azure App Service. In that case, one has to use Azure VM to create environment for the programming language.
