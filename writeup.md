I chose webapp for these reasons:

1- Azure App Service is cheaper when compared to VM especially I'm using the free tier.

2- Azure App Service requires much less managerial efforts in comparison to Azure Virtual Machines.
The development of app is much simpler and faster in Azure App Service.

3- I don't need any further access for OS.

changes will make me change my choice to VM:

1- need for more computation power.

2- needs to add more features that need further access to OS.

3- when we have deman to change the programming language to anyone not listed in app service supported languages.
